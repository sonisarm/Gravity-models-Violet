# Code for the following publication: "*Connectivity in two endangered violets in the Canary Islands: how topography, temperature and water availability shape gene flow and diversity in Viola cheiranthifolia and Viola guaxarensis*"


This GitHub page provides a step-by-step guide to the analyses presented in the publication, "*Connectivity in two endangered violets in the Canary Islands: how topography, temperature, and water availability shape gene flow and diversity in Viola cheiranthifolia and Viola guaxarensis.*" This study is part of the GENCLIMA project, which aims to evaluate functional connectivity among high-mountain and laurel forest species in the Canary Islands, with a focus on preserving genetic diversity and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

The project's specific objectives are to (1) identify correlations between genetic diversity and environmental variables, (2) assess the functional connectivity of V. cheiranthifolia and V. guaxarensis at El Teide Summit, Tenerife, Spain, (3) determine which landscape variables influence gene flow in each species, and (4) evaluate changes in connectivity under projected climate change scenarios.

### 00-Sampling
The sampling scheme used here is individual-based, differing from the population-level analyses commonly applied in metapopulation studies. This approach enhances our ability to discern between isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance patterns and allows for a more precise identification of landscape factors influencing gene flow.
