### 0. Introduction
This github page is to explain step-by-step the statistical analyses presented in the paper entitled "Connectivity in two endangered violets in the Canary Islands: how topography, temperature and water availability shape gene flow and diversity in Viola cheiranthifolia and Viola guaxarensis". This paper is part of the project GENCLIMA that aims to evaluate functional connectivity in high-mountain and laurel forest species in the Canary Islands to maintain genetic diversity and mitigate climate change impact on these species.

### 1. Sampling
The sampling scheme used here is individual-based, differing from the population-level analyses commonly applied in metapopulation studies. This approach enhances our ability to discern between isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance patterns and allows for a more precise identification of landscape factors influencing gene flow.

### 2. Genetic diversity



### 3. Gravity models
Functional connectivity and environmental factors influence on connectivity

### 4. Climate change
Projected connectivity changes under future climate change scenarios
