# Code for the following publication: "Connectivity in two endangered violets in the Canary Islands: how topography, temperature and water availability shape gene flow and diversity in *Viola cheiranthifolia* and *Viola guaxarensis*"

This github page is to explain step-by-step the statistical analyses presented in the publication entitled "Connectivity in two endangered violets in the Canary Islands: how topography, temperature and water availability shape gene flow and diversity in *Viola cheiranthifolia* and *Viola guaxarensis*". This paper is part of the project GENCLIMA that aims to evaluate functional connectivity in high-mountain and laurel forest species in the Canary Islands to maintain genetic diversity and mitigate climate change impact on these species.

Specifically, the object of this project is to (1) identify correlations between genetic diversity and environmental variables; (2) assess the functional connectivity of *V. cheiranthifolia* and *V. guaxarensis* in el Teide Summit, Tenerife, Spain; (3) determine which landscape variables influence gene flow in each species; and (4) evaluate changes in connectivity under future climate change scenarios.

### 00-Sampling
The sampling scheme used here is individual-based, differing from the population-level analyses commonly applied in metapopulation studies. This approach enhances our ability to discern between isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-resistance patterns and allows for a more precise identification of landscape factors influencing gene flow.
